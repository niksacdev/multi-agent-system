# Security Policy

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

This repository demonstrates secure coding practices for AI-powered loan processing systems.

### API Key Security

**NEVER commit API keys or secrets to version control!**

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your API keys to `.env` 
3. Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (already configured)
4. Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration

### Data Privacy

This system implements privacy-by-design principles:

- **No Real SSNs**: The system uses UUID-based `applicant_id` instead of SSNs
- **No PII in Logs**: Sensitive data is never logged
- **Secure Parameters**: All MCP server calls use secure identifiers
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is collected and processed

### Secure Development

- All dependencies are managed through `uv` with lock files
- Regular security audits with `uv pip audit`
- Comprehensive test coverage (>83%)
- Type checking with mypy
- Linting with ruff

## 🐛 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-email@example.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a detailed response within 5 business days.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key-based authentication for AI services
- Secure MCP server communication
- Role-based agent permissions

### Data Protection
- Applicant IDs (UUIDs) instead of SSNs
- Encrypted sensitive data in transit
- Audit logging for compliance

### Input Validation
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Regex patterns for format verification
- Boundary checking for numerical inputs

## 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting a PR:

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] No real PII in test data
- [ ] All inputs validated
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- [ ] Dependencies updated and audited
- [ ] Tests pass with >80% coverage

## 🔄 Dependency Management

Regular dependency updates:
```bash
# Update dependencies
uv sync

# Audit for vulnerabilities
uv pip audit

# Update to latest secure versions
uv update
```

## 📜 Compliance

This system is designed with compliance in mind:

- **FCRA**: Fair Credit Reporting Act compliance
- **ECOA**: Equal Credit Opportunity Act adherence  
- **GDPR**: Privacy-by-design principles
- **SOC2**: Audit trail and access controls

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

1. **MCP Servers**: Currently run on localhost without authentication. In production:
   - Add authentication to MCP servers
   - Use TLS for MCP communications
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **API Keys**: Currently single API key for all agents. In production:
   - Use separate keys per agent
   - Implement key rotation
   - Add usage monitoring

3. **Audit Logging**: Basic logging implemented. In production:
   - Send logs to SIEM
   - Implement tamper-proof audit trail
   - Add compliance reporting
