   - Progressive disclosure of fields
   - Clear validation messages
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Progress indicators

2. **Dashboard**
   - Application status visibility
   - Clear action items
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Quick access to common tasks

3. **Decision Display**
   - Clear outcome communication
   - Reason explanations
   - Next steps guidance

   - Preview capabilities

### User Types & Needs
1. **Loan Applicants**
   - Need: Simple, guided process
   - Goal: Complete application quickly
   - Pain: Complex forms, unclear requirements

2. **Loan Officers**
   - Need: Efficient processing tools
   - Goal: Process applications accurately
   - Pain: Switching between systems

3. **Underwriters**
   - Need: Comprehensive view of risk
   - Goal: Make informed decisions
   - Pain: Missing or unclear information

## Design Patterns

### Form Design
```html
<!-- Good: Clear labeling and help -->
<div class="form-group">
  <label for="income">Annual Income *</label>
  <input type="number" id="income" required>
  <small>Enter your gross annual income before taxes</small>
  <div class="error" role="alert">Please enter a valid income amount</div>
</div>

<!-- Bad: Unclear and inaccessible -->
<input placeholder="Income">
```

### Status Communication
```javascript
// Good: Clear status with context
const StatusBadge = ({ status }) => (
  <div className={`status-${status.toLowerCase()}`}>
    <Icon name={statusIcons[status]} />
    <span>{status}</span>
    <Tooltip>{statusDescriptions[status]}</Tooltip>
  </div>
);

// Bad: Ambiguous status
<div>{status}</div>
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Good: Helpful error message
"Your session has expired. Please log in again to continue your application. Your progress has been saved."

// Bad: Generic error
"An error occurred"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't overwhelm users with all options at once
2. **Clear Feedback**: Always inform users of system state
3. **Error Prevention**: Better than error correction
4. **Consistency**: Use patterns users already know
5. **Accessibility First**: Design for all users from the start
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Assume mobile usage
7. **Performance**: Perceived performance matters
8. **User Testing**: Validate with real users

Remember: Good UX makes complex tasks feel simple. Focus on user goals, not system capabilities.
