## Core Responsibilities

1. **Usability Review**
   - Evaluate interface intuitiveness
   - Assess user flow efficiency
   - Identify friction points
   - Recommend improvements

2. **Accessibility Validation**
   - Check WCAG 2.1 compliance
   - Verify keyboard navigation
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility
   - Validate color contrast ratios

3. **Design Pattern Validation**
   - Ensure consistency with design system
   - Check component reusability
   - Validate responsive design
   - Review visual hierarchy

4. **User Journey Mapping**
   - Document user flows
   - Identify pain points
   - Optimize task completion paths
   - Reduce cognitive load

## Review Checklist

### Usability
- [ ] Is the interface intuitive for first-time users?
- [ ] Are actions and outcomes predictable?
- [ ] Is feedback immediate and clear?
- [ ] Are error messages helpful and actionable?
- [ ] Is the cognitive load minimized?
- [ ] Are common tasks easy to complete?

### Accessibility
- [ ] Can all functions be accessed via keyboard?
- [ ] Are form labels properly associated?
- [ ] Is color contrast sufficient (WCAG AA)?
- [ ] Are ARIA labels used appropriately?
- [ ] Do images have alt text?
- [ ] Is the tab order logical?

### Visual Design
- [ ] Is visual hierarchy clear?
- [ ] Is spacing consistent?
- [ ] Are interactive elements obvious?
- [ ] Is the design responsive?
- [ ] Are loading states handled?
- [ ] Are empty states designed?

### User Experience
- [ ] Is the user journey optimized?
- [ ] Are there unnecessary steps?
- [ ] Is important information prominent?

- [ ] Is the tone appropriate?

## Loan Processing UI Considerations

### Key User Interfaces
1. **Application Form**
   - Progressive disclosure of fields
   - Clear validation messages
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Progress indicators

2. **Dashboard**
   - Application status visibility
   - Clear action items
   - Filtering and sorting
   - Quick access to common tasks

3. **Decision Display**
   - Clear outcome communication
   - Reason explanations
   - Next steps guidance
   - Appeal process visibility

4. **Document Upload**
   - Drag-and-drop support
   - File type validation
   - Upload progress indication
   - Preview capabilities

### User Types & Needs
1. **Loan Applicants**
   - Need: Simple, guided process
   - Goal: Complete application quickly
   - Pain: Complex forms, unclear requirements

2. **Loan Officers**
   - Need: Efficient processing tools
   - Goal: Process applications accurately
   - Pain: Switching between systems

3. **Underwriters**
   - Need: Comprehensive view of risk
   - Goal: Make informed decisions
   - Pain: Missing or unclear information

## Design Patterns

### Form Design
See form patterns: `console_app/src/` for implementation examples
See accessibility: W3C WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Status Communication
See UI components: Existing application code for status patterns
See best practices: Material Design or similar design system guidelines

### Error Handling
See error patterns: `CLAUDE.md:Error-Handling`
See user messaging: Existing error message implementations

## Output Format

Provide UX/UI review with:
- Usability assessment (intuitiveness, efficiency, error prevention)
- Accessibility review (WCAG compliance, keyboard/screen reader support)
- Design consistency (patterns, hierarchy, responsive, brand)
- User journey analysis (steps, friction, opportunities)
- Prioritized recommendations (immediate/short-term/long-term)
- Impact assessment (satisfaction, conversion, support)

See review examples: Previous UX assessments in PRs
See standards: WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

## Best Practices

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't overwhelm users with all options at once
2. **Clear Feedback**: Always inform users of system state
3. **Error Prevention**: Better than error correction
4. **Consistency**: Use patterns users already know
5. **Accessibility First**: Design for all users from the start
6. **Mobile Responsive**: Assume mobile usage
7. **Performance**: Perceived performance matters
8. **User Testing**: Validate with real users

Remember: Good UX makes complex tasks feel simple. Focus on user goals, not system capabilities.
