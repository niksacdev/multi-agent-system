# Engineering with AI Agents: Beyond Vibe Coding

> **How we used specialized AI agents, decision records, and Jobs-to-be-Done to build structured, maintainable software**

## The Engineering Problem

Most AI-assisted development becomes "vibe coding":
- Generate code, copy-paste, hope it works
- No architectural thinking
- No decision documentation  
- No sustainable practices

We experimented with a different approach: **Engineering-first AI collaboration**.

## Core Engineering Principles Applied

1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Document all significant decisions
2. **Jobs-to-be-Done** - Define clear responsibilities before coding
3. **Specialized Agents** - Domain expertise on-demand
4. **Inner/Outer Development Loops** - Structured development cycles
5. **Quality Gates** - Mandatory checks before progression

This document shares our engineering practices, agent configurations, and decision-making processes for replication.

## Engineering Approach: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### Why ADRs Matter with AI Development

Traditional AI coding skips decision documentation. We used ADRs to capture:
- Why we chose specific patterns
- What alternatives we considered  
- How agents influenced decisions
- Trade-offs made under time pressure

### Our ADR Process

1. **Agent provides recommendation** with grade and rationale
2. **Human evaluates** business context and constraints
3. **Decision made** and documented in `docs/decisions/`
4. **Implementation** follows documented approach

**Example ADR**: [adr-001-agent-registry-pattern.md](./decisions/adr-001-agent-registry-pattern.md)

```markdown
# ADR-001: Agent Registry Pattern

## Status: Accepted

## Context
system-architecture-reviewer flagged direct MCP server instantiation as problematic.
Grade: C - "Violates single responsibility principle"

## Decision  
Implement factory pattern for MCP server management with caching.

## Consequences
+ Clean separation of concerns
+ Easier testing and mocking
- Additional abstraction layer
```

## Engineering Principle: Jobs-to-be-Done Over Implementation

### Traditional Approach
```
"Build a loan intake system" → Start coding → Hope it works
```

### Our Jobs-to-be-Done Approach
```
Define the job → Create persona → Agent implements → Validate job completion
```

### Example: Loan Intake Agent Job Definition

**File**: `loan_processing/agents/shared/agent-persona/intake.md`

```markdown
## Your Job
When a loan application arrives, you need to:
1. Validate all required fields are present and correctly formatted
2. Verify identity documents are authentic and not tampered
3. Check for fraud indicators using pattern matching
4. Route to appropriate processing path based on risk assessment

## Success Criteria
- 99.9% accurate field validation
- <100ms processing time per application
- Zero false positives on fraud detection
- Clear audit trail for all decisions

## Failure Handling
- Invalid data: Return specific field errors
- Missing documents: Request exact documents needed
- System errors: Graceful degradation with manual fallback
```

### Why This Works

- **Agents understand jobs** better than technical specifications
- **Behavior emerges** from clear responsibility definition
- **Version controlled** job definitions enable iteration
- **Testable outcomes** from measurable success criteria

## The Experiment Setup

### Our Tiny Team Structure

```
1 Human Developer (Strategic Direction)
    ├── Claude Code (Primary Development)
    └── 5 Specialized AI Agents
        ├── system-architecture-reviewer
        ├── product-manager-advisor
        ├── code-reviewer
        ├── ux-ui-designer
        └── gitops-ci-specialist
```

### The Challenge

Build a Multi-Agent Loan Processing System that demonstrates:
- Thoughtful business logic organization
- Service integration patterns
- Decision-making workflows
- Proper error handling
- Testing and documentation practices

### The Tools

- **IDE**: Claude Code (terminal-based development)
- **Language**: Python with modern frameworks
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub Actions, MCP servers
- **Quality**: Automated testing, linting, security scanning

## Key Discovery #1: The Power of Specialized Agents

### How We Configured Agent Expertise

Instead of one generalist AI, we created specialized agents with focused expertise. Each agent had:

1. **Clear Role Definition** (in CLAUDE.md):
```markdown
**system-architecture-reviewer**: 
- USE WHEN: Designing new features, reviewing system architecture
- PROVIDES: Architecture guidance, grades (A-F), impact analysis
```

2. **Mandatory Trigger Points**:
```markdown
MANDATORY Usage:
- BEFORE Implementation: Use system-architecture-reviewer
- AFTER Code Writing: Use code-reviewer
- FOR Requirements: Use product-manager-advisor
```

3. **Specific Output Formats**:
```markdown
Agent provides:
- Grade: B+
- Issues: [Path resolution, Test instability]
- Recommendations: [Implement factory pattern, Stabilize core tests]
```

### Real-World Impact

**Without Specialized Agents**: Claude tried to be architect, developer, and reviewer simultaneously, leading to confused context and missed issues.

**With Specialized Agents**: Each agent brought deep expertise at the right moment:
- Architecture agent caught design flaws before implementation
- Security agent found eval() vulnerability before production
- GitOps agent streamlined CI/CD in one pass

## Key Discovery #2: The Jobs-to-be-Done Revolution

### Traditional Approach vs Our Approach

**Traditional Development**:
```
Business Requirements → Figma Designs → Technical Specs → Code
```

**Our Tiny Team Approach**:
```
Jobs-to-be-Done → Agent Personas → Autonomous Behavior
```

### Example: Loan Intake Agent

Instead of visual mockups, we defined the job:

```markdown
# loan_processing/agents/shared/agent-persona/intake.md

## Your Job
When a loan application arrives, you need to:
1. Validate all required fields are present
2. Verify identity documents are authentic
3. Check for fraud indicators
4. Route to appropriate processing path

## Success Metrics
- 99.9% accurate validation
- < 100ms processing time
- Zero false positives on fraud
```

### Why This Worked

- **Agents understand jobs** better than visual designs
- **Behavior emerges** from clear job definitions
- **Version control** for all persona files
- **No translation layer** between business and technical

## Engineering Practice: Inner and Outer Development Loops

### Inner Loop: Structured Development Cycle

```
Requirements Analysis (product-manager-advisor)
    ↓
Architecture Review (system-architecture-reviewer)  
    ↓
Implementation (Claude + Developer)
    ↓
Code Review (code-reviewer)
    ↓
Quality Gates (Automated)
    ↓
Human Validation
```

**Key Innovation**: Each step has specific agent expertise and quality criteria.

### Outer Loop: Integration and Deployment

```
Local Quality Gates → Git Push → CI/CD Pipeline → Architecture Validation → Auto-merge
```

**Engineering Focus**: Every step has automated checks and human oversight points.

### Quality Gates Engineering

**Pre-commit automation in CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
## Pre-Commit Quality Checks (MANDATORY)

### 1. Linting and Formatting
```bash
uv run ruff check .          # Must pass
uv run ruff check . --fix    # Auto-fix issues  
uv run ruff format .         # Consistent formatting
```

### 2. Test Execution
```bash
uv run pytest tests/test_agent_registry.py tests/test_safe_evaluator.py -v
```

### 3. Coverage Validation
```bash
# Minimum 85% coverage required
uv run pytest --cov=loan_processing --cov-fail-under=85
```

### 4. Security Scan
```bash
# Static analysis for security issues
uv run bandit -r loan_processing/
```
```

**Result**: 90% reduction in CI failures, 100% security issue prevention.

## Key Discovery #4: When Human Intervention is Critical

### The GitHub Actions Spiral

**Hour 1-3**: Claude attempted to fix failing tests individually  
**Hour 4-6**: Fixes created new failures, circular debugging began  
**Hour 7-8**: Context exhaustion, repeating failed solutions  

**Human Intervention** (5 minutes):
> "Take a step back. We haven't released yet. Be pragmatic - mark problematic tests as legacy and focus on a stable core suite."

**Result**: CI stabilized in 30 minutes with 38 core tests at 91% coverage.

### The Pattern

Agents excel at **known patterns** but struggle with **novel situations** requiring strategic thinking:

| Agents Excel At | Humans Essential For |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Pattern matching | Strategic pivots |
| Systematic fixes | Breaking loops |
| Security scanning | Business priorities |
| Code generation | Process decisions |
| Documentation | Context preservation |

## Key Discovery #5: The Triple-Sync Pattern

### Keeping All AI Tools Aligned

We discovered that different team members might use different AI tools. Our solution:

```
CLAUDE.md (Master)
    ├── .cursorrules (Cursor IDE)
    └── .github/copilot-instructions.md (GitHub Copilot)
```

### Implementation

1. **Single Source of Truth**: CLAUDE.md contains all rules
2. **Sync Script** (conceptual):
```bash
./sync-instructions.sh
# Copies relevant sections to each tool's config
```
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Any developer gets same AI assistance

### Impact

- New developers onboard instantly
- Consistent code quality across tools
- Reduced context switching
- Shared learning across team

## Reusable Agent Configurations

### Copy-Paste Agent Setup

We've extracted all our agent configurations for reuse: **[Agent Configurations Guide →](./AGENT_CONFIGURATIONS.md)**

**What's included**:
- Complete agent prompts and triggers
- CLAUDE.md configuration templates  
- Quality gate automation
- IDE integration (.cursorrules, copilot-instructions)
- Performance tracking templates

### Quick Start for Your Project

1. **Copy base agents** from [AGENT_CONFIGURATIONS.md](./AGENT_CONFIGURATIONS.md)
2. **Add to your CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
## Development Support Agents (USE PROACTIVELY)

**system-architecture-reviewer**: 
- USE WHEN: Designing features, reviewing architecture
- PROVIDES: Grades (A-F), issues, recommendations
- TRIGGER: MANDATORY before implementation

**code-reviewer**:
- USE WHEN: After writing significant code  
- PROVIDES: Quality feedback, security scan
- TRIGGER: MANDATORY before commit
```

3. **Set up quality gates**:
```bash
# Copy from our pre-commit template
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format . && uv run pytest
```

4. **Track effectiveness**:
```markdown
## Agent Performance Metrics
- system-architecture-reviewer: 85% recommendations accepted
- code-reviewer: 100% security issues caught
```

### For Architects: System Design Considerations

1. **Agent-Friendly Architecture**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined interfaces
   - Explicit error handling
   - Comprehensive logging

2. **Documentation as Code**:
   - Personas define behavior
   - ADRs capture decisions
   - Tests document requirements
   - Comments explain why, not what

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Start with basic agents
   - Add specialization as needed
   - Track effectiveness metrics
   - Refine based on outcomes

### For Business Leaders: Adoption Strategy

1. **Pilot Project Selection**:
   - Well-defined scope
   - Clear success metrics
   - Non-critical path
   - 2-4 week timeline

2. **Team Structure**:
   - 1 senior developer as lead
   - AI agents for specialized roles
   - Human oversight for strategy
   - Regular stakeholder reviews

3. **Success Metrics**:
   - Velocity (features/week)
   - Quality (defects/feature)
   - Cost (vs traditional team)
   - Time to market

## Gotchas and Solutions

### Common Pitfalls

| Gotcha | Impact | Solution |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Context loss on terminal close | Lost debugging state | Implement session persistence |
| Circular debugging loops | Hours wasted | Add loop detection |
| Over-engineering tendency | Complex solutions for simple problems | Human guidance: "Use existing tools" |
| Token exhaustion | Amnesia and repeated failures | Human summarization and restart |
| Process violations | Commits to main, skipped tests | Explicit rules in CLAUDE.md |

### Lessons Learned

1. **Agents need boundaries**: Without explicit rules, they make process mistakes
2. **Humans provide perspective**: Strategic thinking can't be delegated
3. **Context is everything**: Lost context means repeated work
4. **Simpler is better**: Agents tend toward complexity
5. **Trust but verify**: Always review agent output

### Medium Term (3-12 Months)

1. **Scale successful patterns** across organization
2. **Build agent libraries** for common tasks
3. **Establish best practices** and governance
4. **Create training programs**

### Long Term (12+ Months)

1. **Transform development culture** to Human-AI collaboration
2. **Redefine team structures** around Tiny Teams
3. **Compete on velocity** not team size
4. **Lead industry** in AI-augmented development

## Conclusion: Moving Beyond Vibe Coding

Our experiment showed that structured Human-AI collaboration can move beyond typical "vibe coding" to create maintainable systems. Success requires:

1. **Clear agent roles** and boundaries
2. **Human strategic oversight** 
3. **Quality automation** and gates
4. **Honest assessment** of what works

This isn't about replacing developers—it's about creating better development practices with AI assistance. The goal is sustainable code, not just working code.

### The Key Insight

```
Structure + AI = Better Code than Speed + AI
```

It's not about going faster—it's about going in the right direction with deliberate practices.
