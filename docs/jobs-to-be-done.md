# Jobs-to-be-Done Framework for Loan Processing

## Overview

The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework is the foundation of our multi-agent system design. Rather than organizing around internal processes, our agents are designed around the jobs customers are trying to accomplish when applying for loans.

## JTBD Theory in Loan Processing

### Core Principle

> "People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."

Applied to lending:
> "People don't want a loan application process. They want confident access to capital for their life goals."

### The Customer's Perspective

When someone applies for a loan, they're not just seeking money. They're hiring our loan process to:
- **Achieve a life goal** (buy a home, start a business, consolidate debt)
- **Reduce anxiety** about their financial future
- **Gain confidence** that they're making the right decision
- **Preserve dignity** throughout the evaluation process
- **Maintain control** over their financial narrative

## Core Job Architecture

### Primary Customer Job Statement

**"When I need financing for [specific purpose], I want to get a fair evaluation of my application quickly and transparently, so I can move forward with confidence that I'm getting appropriate terms for my situation."**

This breaks down into:
- **Situation**: Need financing for specific purpose
- **Motivation**: Fair, quick, transparent evaluation  
- **Outcome**: Confidence in appropriate terms

### Job Types Hierarchy

#### 1. Functional Jobs (What needs to be accomplished)
- Submit complete application information
- Get creditworthiness evaluated fairly
- Have income and employment verified
- Receive appropriate loan terms
- Understand decision rationale

#### 2. Emotional Jobs (How they want to feel)
- **Confident** in the fairness of the process
- **Respected** as a person, not just a credit score
- **Informed** about what's happening and why
- **Hopeful** about approval chances
- **Validated** for their financial responsibility

#### 3. Social Jobs (How they want to be perceived)
- Demonstrate financial competence to family/partners
- Maintain professional credibility
- Show responsible borrowing behavior
- Preserve relationships with financial institutions
- Build reputation for future financial needs

## JTBD Implementation Framework

### 1. Job Mapping Process

For each customer interaction, we map:
1. **Triggering Event**: What caused the customer to start this job?
2. **Job Steps**: What are they trying to accomplish at each stage?
3. **Desired Outcomes**: What would success look like to them?
4. **Pain Points**: What typically goes wrong or causes frustration?
5. **Emotional Needs**: How do they want to feel throughout?

### 2. Solution Design

Each agent capability is designed to:
- **Complete a job step** more effectively than alternatives
- **Eliminate a pain point** that customers commonly experience
- **Create emotional value** beyond just functional completion
- **Enable the next job step** to proceed smoothly

### 3. Success Measurement

We measure success through customer-centric metrics:
- **Job Completion Rate**: How often do customers successfully complete their jobs?
- **Effort Score**: How much effort does it take to complete each job?
- **Emotional Satisfaction**: How do customers feel about the experience?
- **Recommendation Likelihood**: Would they hire our process again?

## JTBD vs. Traditional Process Design

### Traditional Approach
- Organized around internal departments
- Optimized for operational efficiency
- Measured by process metrics
- Designed from institution's perspective

### JTBD Approach
- Organized around customer jobs
- Optimized for job completion
- Measured by customer outcomes
- Designed from customer's perspective

### Example Comparison

**Traditional**: "Process credit application efficiently"
- Metric: Applications processed per hour
- Design: Minimize processing time and cost
- Result: Fast processing, poor customer experience

**JTBD**: "Help customer get fair credit evaluation"
- Metric: Customer confidence in fairness + speed
- Design: Thorough, explainable, fast evaluation
- Result: Customer satisfaction + operational efficiency

## Benefits of JTBD-Driven Agent Design

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Product Teams
1. **Start with customer jobs**, not internal processes
2. **Map the complete job journey**, not just touchpoints
3. **Design for job completion**, not just task completion
4. **Measure customer outcomes**, not just operational metrics

### For Engineering Teams
1. **Agent capabilities** should map to specific job steps
