# ADR-004: Agent Handoff Pattern Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our initial sequential orchestrator implementation used primitive `Runner.run()` calls with string-based context passing between agents. This approach had several critical limitations:

### Problems with Original Implementation

1. **Manual Orchestration**: Central orchestrator manually called each agent sequentially
2. **String-Based Context**: Agent results converted to strings, losing type safety and structure  
3. **Brittle Output Parsing**: Manual string parsing to extract decisions (`_parse_risk_decision`)
4. **No Agent Awareness**: Agents operated in isolation without knowledge of workflow context
5. **No True Handoffs**: Agents didn't actually hand off to each other - orchestrator managed all transitions

### Original Pattern Issues

```python
# Problematic approach
intake_result = await Runner.run(intake_agent_instance, input="...")
context["intake_assessment"] = str(intake_result)  # Data loss
credit_result = await Runner.run(credit_agent_instance, input=f"...")  # Manual assembly
```

This pattern violated the principle of agent autonomy and didn't leverage the OpenAI Agent SDK's sophisticated handoff capabilities.

### Need for Improvement

The system-architecture-reviewer identified this as a critical architectural weakness that prevented:
- True agent autonomy in workflow decisions
- Structured communication between agents
- Scalable orchestration patterns
- Type-safe data transfer
- Proper audit trails of agent decisions

## Decision

**Implement proper OpenAI Agent SDK handoff patterns with structured communication:**

### Phase 1: Structured Data Objects (Implemented)

1. **Created Handoff Context Models** (`loan_processing/models/handoff.py`):
   - `AgentHandoffContext`: Base context for all handoffs
   - `IntakeAssessmentResult`: Structured intake results
   - `CreditAssessmentResult`: Structured credit assessment
   - `IncomeVerificationResult`: Structured income verification
   - `RiskAssessmentResult`: Structured final decision
   - Type-safe data transfer with Pydantic validation

2. **Replaced String Context** with structured objects maintaining:
   - Type safety through Pydantic models
   - Complete audit trail information
   - Confidence scores and reasoning
   - Structured decision data

### Phase 2: Agent Handoff Configuration (Implemented)

1. **Updated Agent Definitions** to include handoff configurations:
   ```python
   # New handoff pattern
   return Agent(
       name="Intake Agent",
       instructions=load_persona("intake") + structured_output_instructions,
       handoffs=[
           handoff(
               agent=credit_agent(model),
               name="transfer_to_credit_agent",
               description="Transfer to credit agent after validation"
           )
       ]
   )
   ```

2. **Agent Chain Configuration**:
   - Intake Agent → hands off to → Credit Agent
   - Credit Agent → hands off to → Income Agent  
   - Income Agent → hands off to → Risk Agent
   - Risk Agent → provides final decision (no further handoff)

3. **Structured Output Instructions**: Each agent required to provide JSON-formatted results

### Phase 3: Handoff-Based Orchestrator (Implemented)

1. **Created New Orchestrator** (`handoff_sequential.py`):
   - Single entry point with Intake Agent
   - Agents autonomously manage handoffs
   - Structured result parsing
   - Backward compatibility with existing interface

2. **Simplified Orchestration Logic**:
   ```python
   # New approach - single entry point
   final_result = await Runner.run(
       intake_agent_instance,
       input=structured_context
   )
   # Agents handle all handoffs automatically
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Agent Handoff Chain

**Intake Agent** → **Credit Agent** → **Income Agent** → **Risk Agent**

Each agent:
1. Performs its specialized assessment
2. Generates structured JSON output
3. Automatically hands off to the next agent
4. Passes accumulated context forward

### Structured Output Format

Each agent provides results in standardized JSON format:

```json
{
    "assessment_type": "intake|credit|income|risk",
    "status": "specific_status_values",
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
    "key_findings": ["structured", "results"],
    "next_action": "automatic_handoff_or_final"
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

- Original `process_application_sequential()` function maintained
- Delegates to new handoff implementation
- Same return type and interface
- No breaking changes for existing code

### Error Handling Improvements

1. **Structured Error Context**: Errors maintain context through handoff chain
2. **JSON Parsing Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of malformed agent outputs
3. **Decision Status Mapping**: Robust mapping from agent recommendations to system decisions
