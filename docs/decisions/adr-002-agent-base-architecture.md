# Loan Processing Agent Base Architecture

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to establish the foundational architecture for loan processing agents that will integrate with the Microsoft Agent Framework. The system needs to support multiple specialized agents (credit assessment, income verification, risk analysis) that can work independently or in orchestrated workflows.

Key requirements:

- Modular agent design following Agent Framework patterns
- Consistent error handling and logging
- Structured assessment outputs
- Tool integration capability
- Support for both development and production environments

## Decision Drivers

- **Agent Framework Integration**: Must properly integrate with Microsoft Agent Framework ChatClientAgent patterns
- **Modularity**: Each agent should be independently testable and deployable
- **Consistency**: All agents should follow the same base patterns for error handling, logging, and responses
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agent types and tools
- **Development Experience**: Support for development with placeholder implementations when Agent Framework is not available
- **Tool Integration**: Easy integration with external APIs and services
- **Structured Output**: All assessments should produce consistent, typed results

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Direct Agent Framework Implementation

- Inherit directly from ChatClientAgent
- Minimal abstraction layer
- Direct tool registration

### Option 2: Abstract Base Class with Agent Framework Composition

- Create LoanProcessingAgent base class
- Compose ChatClientAgent internally
- Abstract common patterns (error handling, assessment flow)
- Standardize tool initialization and response parsing

### Option 3: Pure Domain Models with Separate Agent Layer

- Separate domain logic from agent framework
- Agents as thin wrappers around domain services
- No direct inheritance from agent framework classes

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Option 2: Abstract Base Class with Agent Framework Composition**", because:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps loan processing logic separate from framework specifics
2. **Consistency**: Ensures all agents follow the same patterns for assessment workflow
3. **Development Support**: Allows for placeholder implementations during development
4. **Error Handling**: Centralizes error handling and logging patterns
5. **Testing**: Easier to unit test individual components
6. **Evolution**: Can adapt to Agent Framework changes without modifying all agents

### Consequences

**Good:**

- Consistent agent implementation patterns across all loan processing agents
- Centralized error handling and logging
- Development-friendly with fallback implementations
- Clear separation between framework concerns and business logic
- Easier to add new agent types following established patterns

**Bad:**

- Additional abstraction layer adds some complexity
- Need to maintain compatibility with Agent Framework evolution
- Placeholder implementations need to be maintained

## Validation

### Code Review Requirements

- [ ] Base class follows Agent Framework ChatClientAgent patterns correctly
- [ ] Error handling covers all expected failure scenarios
- [ ] Tool initialization pattern is consistent and extensible
- [ ] Assessment response parsing is type-safe and robust
- [ ] Development placeholder implementations don't interfere with production

### Implementation Validation

- [ ] All specialized agents can inherit from base class without modification
- [ ] Tool integration works with external services
- [ ] Error scenarios produce appropriate structured responses
- [ ] Logging provides sufficient debugging information
- [ ] Assessment results are properly typed and validated

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Agents work correctly with Agent Framework in production environment
- [ ] Development mode works without Agent Framework dependencies
- [ ] Tool calls execute correctly and handle failures gracefully
- [ ] Response parsing produces valid assessment objects

## Next Steps

1. **Design Review**: Review the proposed base class architecture
2. **Code Review**: Review the implementation details of LoanProcessingAgent
3. **GitHub Issues**: Create specific implementation tasks for individual agents
4. **Collaborative Development**: Use GitHub Copilot agent for implementing individual specialized agents

## Files Affected

- `loan_processing/agents/base.py` - Base agent class implementation
- `loan_processing/agents/__init__.py` - Package exports
- `loan_processing/models/` - Assessment result models (already implemented)

## Dependencies

- Microsoft Agent Framework (ChatClientAgent, ai_function decorator)
- Pydantic for structured assessment results
- Python logging for observability
